     ---
     title: omg
     description: this is how to create nuclear weaponry in your backyard (IAEA not approved)
     color: "#ffffff"
     ---

  ${c.bold(c.cyan("üìù bloggy"))} uses config.yaml for default values & paths (like template.html and output dir)
     so uh... pro tip: customize everything in config.yaml so you never have to touch this script
